<h1> Code Test for Wonde</h1>

<p> This is my completed code test for the position at Wonde. Thanks for taking the time to look at this project. I've really enjoyed completing this task and working with your API, regardless was a great learning experience and I really enjoyed getting the oppertunity. </p>

<p> Just wanted to add some extra notes to the project, spesifically to explain why I've went about spesific decisions and issues that I wasn't able to resolve within the given time: </p>
<li> Preformance - The length of time it takes to make an API call is quite long, alot longer than I'm happy with on my system. I did try to test this, but found it to be inconsistent. </li>
<li> PHPUnit Tests - Although I'm used to writing Unit Tests regularly, this is for Java not PHP. So I've attempted to learn writting tests using PHPUnit. As well as this, I implemented the tests after writing the program and found it difficult to write these for Controllers. I more rather should have implemented tests thoughout to help implement quicker so If I was to be given another oppertunity I would have went about it this way. </li>
